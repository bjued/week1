<p class="title">Privacy Policy</p>

<p class="updated">Last Modified on 04/14/2011</p>

	<p>At Kuipp, our goal is to provide you with a safe and enjoyable environment for you and your friends to easily navigate the site and services on the Internet and on mobile devices ("Services"). By using any of our Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure, and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@kuipp.com">legal@kuipp.com</a>.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Information Collection and Use</p>

	<p>The information we receive from users enables us to customize and improve our Services and allow users to interact more efficiently with other users through the Services. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used by Kuipp in the United States or any other country where Kuipp operates. Any submissions of user data or information through our Services are public information, as this is the nature of this service, which is designed to help you easily ask a question in a local community or extended network and receive answers in an efficient, timely manner. The following lists out the primary groups of information collection:</p>

	<p><b>Registration:</b> When you first create and sign-up for a Kuipp account, you provide personal information to help us identify who you are, such as your name, password, photo and email address. Some of this information (ex. your name and photo) is shown publicly on our Services, including your profile page and pages where your information comes in search results. We will never publicly disclose your email address or password through our Services.</p>

	<p><b>Other Information:</b> Additional information that is provided, such as your interests and short biography, will also be made public on our Services. We may use your email to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions provided in the message itself. Additionally, if you send us an email, we may keep your contact information and message information for purposes of responding to your request. Please note that providing information as described in this section is entirely optional and not required to use the Services.</p>

	<p><b>Messages:</b> As mentioned on our Site, our Services are designed to allow you to ask and answer local questions and share information with your friends and with users around you. Most messages, unless specifically directed to a user or group of users, are public. This includes not only the content but also the metadata provided with the messages, such as when you ask a question, answer a question, or provide a comment to an answer.</p>

	<p><b>Direct Messages:</b> Direct Messages, which are private messages sent to an individual user, are private messages intended for that user only. We will not share these private messages with other users unless we are required to disclose such information in order to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or other's rights, property, or safety.</p>

	<p><b>Automatically Collected Information:</b> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Services. Kuipp automatically receives and stores information on our server logs from our Site and mobile application including your IP address, general location, cookie information, pages visited and search terms. Information around usage rates, such as page views and frequency of messages, are also collected. We do not view an individual user's data, but view the data in aggregate form. Analyzing the statistical form of the aggregate data allows us to determine how often certain parts of our Services are used, allowing us to improve the overall experience of the Services. As part of the use of this aggregate information, we may provide this to our partners or affiliates to reflect how our customers are engaging in our Services to help them understand. To confirm, Kuipp will never disclose information that will in any way allow our partners or affiliates to identify you personally.</p>

	<p><b>Location Information:</b> While your time-sensitive location is shared with local users and your followers when you ask and answer a question, your location will never be shared publicly.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Cookies</p>

	<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computerâ€™s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when and how many people visit our pages. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for subsequent visits, monitor anonymous traffic, and compile aggregate data regarding site traffic and interaction, so that we can offer a more engaging site experience. Most browsers allow you to turn off the storage of cookies, thereby preventing your browser from accepting new cookies. We recommend you to leave this function on as turning off cookies will not allow you to take advantage of some of our services.</p>

	<p>Advertisements appearing on our Services may be delivered to users through our various advertising partners or affiliates, who may set cookies to allow their servers to recognize your computer each time you are sent an advertisement to compile information about users who use your computer. While this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Kuipp, this does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers, partners or affiliates.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Information Sharing and Transfer of Data</p>

	<p>Kuipp will not sell, trade, send, or transfer your personal information to any external third parties. Please note that this does not include trusted third parties who help us in the operation of our Services, conducting our business operations, or providing additional services to you. We may only share or disclose your information with your consent, such as with the usage of third party clients to access your account. Kuipp may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public questions, answers, or comments to answers.</p>

	<p>We may disclose your information if it is reasonably necessary to do so in order to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>

	<p>In the situation where we decide to purchase or sell assets, your customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by another third party. Likewise, the same information would also be transferred in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy or reorganization of the company.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Updating your Personal Information</p>

	<p>As a registered user of Kuipp, we will provide all users with the ability to access or modify the personal information provided and associated with you.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Policy Toward Children</p>

	<p>We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our Services are targeted to people who are at least 13 years old or older. If there is the case where we believe we have collected personal information from children under the age of 13, then we will delete such information from our Services as quickly as possible. If you are aware of any children under the age of 13 who are using our Services, please contact us directly at <a href="mailto:legal@kuipp.com">legal@kuipp.com</a></p>

<p class="subtitle">Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>

	<p>Kuipp may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Current use of this information is how we collect information at the time it is used. If any changes are made to the method in which we use personal information, we will notify all users by posting an announcement on our Site, mobile application, or via email. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes are effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
