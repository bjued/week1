<p class="title">About Us</p>

	<p>Kuipp (pronounced like the word "quip") is a mobile Q&A platform that provides users with a fun, fast way to ask and answer questions to discover what's currently happening in a specific area.</p>
	
	<p>Based in San Francisco, Kuipp was founded with the mindset of providing a fun, useful platform for people to discover what's happening in a specific area. We understand that when people are out enjoying the day with their friends, family, or loved ones, there isn't always the time to have all your questions answered regarding local events, performances, or even where to grab a quick bite to eat. As a result, receiving local responses to satisfy all your curiosities fast is the service we're dedicated to providing to our users!</p>
