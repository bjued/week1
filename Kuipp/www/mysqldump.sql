There\nare three types of full-text searches:\n\no A boolean search interprets the search string using the rules of a\n  special query language. The string contains the words to search for.\n  It can also contain operators that specify requirements such that a\n  word must be present or absent in matching rows, or that it should be\n  weighted higher or lower than usual. Common words such as \"some\" or\n  \"then\" are stopwords and do not match if present in the search\n  string. The IN BOOLEAN MODE modifier specifies a boolean search.

There are no special\n  operators. The stopword list applies. In addition, words that are\n  present in 50% or more of the rows are considered common and do not\n  match. Full-text searches are natural language searches if the IN\n  NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE modifier is given or if no modifier is given.\n\no A query expansion search is a modification of a natural language\n  search. The search string is used to perform a natural language\n  search. Then words from the most relevant rows returned by the search\n  are added to the search string and the search is done again.

It is subject to\nremoval in a future version of MySQL.\n\nSince the current implementation of LOAD DATA FROM MASTER and LOAD\nTABLE FROM MASTER is very limited, these statements are deprecated as\nof MySQL 4.1 and removed in MySQL 5.5.\n\nThe recommended alternative solution to using LOAD DATA FROM MASTER or\nLOAD TABLE FROM MASTER is using mysqldump or mysqlhotcopy. The latter\nrequires Perl and two Perl modules (DBI and DBD:mysql) and works for\nMyISAM and ARCHIVE tables only. With mysqldump, you can create SQL\ndumps on the master and pipe (or copy) these to a mysql client on the\nslave. This has the advantage of working for all storage engines, but\ncan be quite slow, since it works using SELECT.\n\nThis statement takes a snapshot of the master and copies it to the\nslave. It updates the values of MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS so\nthat the slave starts replicating from the correct position. Any table\nand database exclusion rules specified with the --replicate-*-do-* and\n--replicate-*-ignore-* options are honored. --replicate-rewrite-db is\nnot taken into account because a user could use this option to set up a\nnonunique mapping such as --replicate-rewrite-db=\"db1->db3\" and\n--replicate-rewrite-db=\"db2->db3\", which would confuse the slave when\nloading tables from the master.\n\nUse of this statement is subject to the following conditions:\n\no It works only for MyISAM tables. Attempting to load a non-MyISAM\n  table results in the following error:\n\nERROR 1189 (08S01): Net error reading from master\n\no It acquires a global read lock on the master while taking the\n  snapshot, which prevents updates on the master during the load\n  operation.\n\nIf you are loading large tables, you might have to increase the values\nof net_read_timeout and net_write_timeout on both the master and slave\nservers. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-system-variables.html.\n\nNote that LOAD DATA FROM MASTER does not copy any tables from the mysql\ndatabase. This makes it easy to have different users and privileges on\nthe master and the slave.\n\nTo use LOAD DATA FROM MASTER, the replication account that is used to\nconnect to the master must have the RELOAD and SUPER privileges on the\nmaster and the SELECT privilege for all master tables you want to load.\nAll master tables for which the user does not have the SELECT privilege\nare ignored by LOAD DATA FROM MASTER. This is because the master hides\nthem from the user: LOAD DATA FROM MASTER calls SHOW DATABASES to know\nthe master databases to load, but SHOW DATABASES returns only databases\nfor which the user has some privilege. See [HELP SHOW DATABASES]. On\nthe slave side, the user that issues LOAD DATA FROM MASTER must have\nprivileges for dropping and creating the databases and tables that are\ncopied.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/load-data-from-master.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/load-data-from-master.html'),(118,'RESET',26,'Syntax:\nRESET reset_option [, reset_option] ...\n\nThe RESET statement is used to clear the state of various server\noperations.

If you have a lock obtained with GET_LOCK(), it is released when\nyou execute RELEASE_LOCK(), execute a new GET_LOCK(), or your\nconnection terminates (either normally or abnormally). Locks obtained\nwith GET_LOCK() do not interact with transactions. That is, committing\na transaction does not release any such locks obtained during the\ntransaction.\n\nThis function can be used to implement application locks or to simulate\nrecord locks. Names are locked on a server-wide basis. If a name has\nbeen locked by one client, GET_LOCK() blocks any request by another\nclient for a lock with the same name. This allows clients that agree on\na given lock name to use the name to perform cooperative advisory\nlocking. But be aware that it also allows a client that is not among\nthe set of cooperating clients to lock a name, either inadvertently or\ndeliberately, and thus prevent any of the cooperating clients from\nlocking that name.

These options\ncan be changed even on slaves that are compiled without SSL support.\nThey are saved to the master.info file, but are ignored if the slave\ndoes not have SSL support enabled.\n\nMASTER_CONNECT_RETRY specifies how many seconds to wait between connect\nretries. The default is 60. The number of reconnection attempts is\nlimited by the --master-retry-count server option; for more\ninformation, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/replication-options.html.\n\nThe next two options (MASTER_BIND and MASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD) are\navailable in MySQL Cluster NDB 6.3 and later, but are not supported in\nmainline MySQL 5.1:\n\nMASTER_BIND is for use on replication slaves having multiple network\ninterfaces, and determines which of the slave\'s network interfaces is\nchosen for connecting to the master. It is also possible to determine\nwhich network interface is to be used in such cases by starting the\nslave mysqld process with the --master-bind option.\n\nThe ability to bind a replication slave to specific network interface\nwas added in MySQL Cluster NDB 6.3.4.\n\nMASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD is used to set the interval in seconds between\nreplication heartbeats. Whenever the master\'s binary log is updated\nwith an event, the waiting period for the next heartbeat is reset.\ninterval is a decimal value having the range 0 to 4294967 seconds and a\nresolution to hundredths of a second; the smallest nonzero value is\n0.01. Heartbeats are sent by the master only if there are no unsent\nevents in the binary log file for a period longer than interval.\n\nSetting interval to 0 disables heartbeats altogether. The default value\nfor interval is equal to the value of slave_net_timeout divided by 2.\n\nSetting @@global.slave_net_timeout to a value less than that of the\ncurrent heartbeat interval results in a warning being issued. The\neffect of issuing RESET SLAVE on the heartbeat interval is to reset it\nto the default value.\n\nMASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD was added in MySQL Cluster NDB 6.3.4.\n\nMASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are the coordinates at which the\nslave I/O thread should begin reading from the master the next time the\nthread starts. RELAY_LOG_FILE and RELAY_LOG_POS are the coordinates at\nwhich the slave SQL thread should begin reading from the relay log the\nnext time the thread starts. If you specify either of MASTER_LOG_FILE\nor MASTER_LOG_POS, you cannot specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS.\nIf neither of MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS is specified, the slave\nuses the last coordinates of the slave SQL thread before CHANGE MASTER\nTO was issued. This ensures that there is no discontinuity in\nreplication, even if the slave SQL thread was late compared to the\nslave I/O thread, when you merely want to change, say, the password to\nuse.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO deletes all relay log files and starts a new one,\nunless you specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS. In that case, relay\nlog files are kept; the relay_log_purge global variable is set silently\nto 0.\n\nBeginning with MySQL 5.1.47, invoking CHANGE MASTER TO causes the\nprevious values for MASTER_HOST, MASTER_PORT, MASTER_LOG_FILE, and\nMASTER_LOG_POS to be written to the error log, along with other\ninformation about the slave\'s state prior to execution.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO is useful for setting up a slave when you have the\nsnapshot of the master and have recorded the master binary log\ncoordinates corresponding to the time of the snapshot. After loading\nthe snapshot into the slave to synchronize it to the slave, you can run\nCHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE=\'log_name\', MASTER_LOG_POS=log_pos on\nthe slave to specify the coodinates at which the slave should begin\nreading the master binary log.\n\nThe following example changes the master server the slave uses and\nestablishes the master binary log coordinates from which the slave\nbegins reading. This is used when you want to set up the slave to\nreplicate the master:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO\n  MASTER_HOST=\'master2.mycompany.com\',\n  MASTER_USER=\'replication\',\n  MASTER_PASSWORD=\'bigs3cret\',\n  MASTER_PORT=3306,\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE=\'master2-bin.001\',\n  MASTER_LOG_POS=4,\n  MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;\n\nThe next example shows an operation that is less frequently employed.\nIt is used when the slave has relay log files that you want it to\nexecute again for some reason. To do this, the master need not be\nreachable. You need only use CHANGE MASTER TO and start the SQL thread\n(START SLAVE SQL_THREAD):\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO\n  RELAY_LOG_FILE=\'slave-relay-bin.006\',\n  RELAY_LOG_POS=4025;\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/change-master-to.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/change-master-to.html'),(186,'DROP DATABASE',38,'Syntax:\nDROP {DATABASE | SCHEMA} [IF EXISTS] db_name\n\nDROP DATABASE drops all tables in the database and deletes the\ndatabase.

One data file is\ncreated and added to the tablespace using this statement. Additional\ndata files may be added to the tablespace by using the ALTER TABLESPACE\nstatement (see [HELP ALTER TABLESPACE]). For rules covering the naming\nof tablespaces, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/identifiers.html.\n\n*Note*: All MySQL Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace.\nThis means that each Disk Data object must be uniquely named (and not\nmerely each Disk Data object of a given type). For example, you cannot\nhave a tablespace and a log file group with the same name, or a\ntablespace and a data file with the same name.\n\nPrior to MySQL Cluster NDB 6.2.17, 6.3.23, and 6.4.3, path and file\nnames for data files could not be longer than 128 characters.\n(Bug#31770 (http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=31770))\n\nA log file group of one or more UNDO log files must be assigned to the\ntablespace to be created with the USE LOGFILE GROUP clause.\nlogfile_group must be an existing log file group created with CREATE\nLOGFILE GROUP (see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/create-logfile-group.html).\nMultiple tablespaces may use the same log file group for UNDO logging.\n\nThe EXTENT_SIZE sets the size, in bytes, of the extents used by any\nfiles belonging to the tablespace. The default value is 1M. The minimum\nsize is 32K, and theoretical maximum is 2G, although the practical\nmaximum size depends on a number of factors. In most cases, changing\nthe extent size does not have any measurable effect on performance, and\nthe default value is recommended for all but the most unusual\nsituations.\n\nAn extent is a unit of disk space allocation. One extent is filled with\nas much data as that extent can contain before another extent is used.\nIn theory, up to 65,535 (64K) extents may used per data file; however,\nthe recommended maximum is 32,768 (32K). The recommended maximum size\nfor a single data file is 32G---that is, 32K extents x 1 MB per extent.\nIn addition, once an extent is allocated to a given partition, it\ncannot be used to store data from a different partition; an extent\ncannot store data from more than one partition. This means, for example\nthat a tablespace having a single datafile whose INITIAL_SIZE is 256 MB\nand whose EXTENT_SIZE is 128M has just two extents, and so can be used\nto store data from at most two different disk data table partitions.\n\nYou can see how many extents remain free in a given data file by\nquerying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table, and so derive an estimate\nfor how much space remains free in the file. For further discussion and\nexamples, see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/files-table.html.\n\nThe INITIAL_SIZE parameter sets the data file\'s total size in bytes.\nOnce the file has been created, its size cannot be changed; however,\nyou can add more data files to the tablespace using ALTER TABLESPACE\n... ADD DATAFILE. See [HELP ALTER TABLESPACE].\n\nINITIAL_SIZE is optional; its default value is 128M.\n\nOn 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for INITIAL_SIZE is 4G.\n(Bug#29186 (http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=29186))\n\nWhen setting EXTENT_SIZE or INITIAL_SIZE (either or both), you may\noptionally follow the number with a one-letter abbreviation for an\norder of magnitude, similar to those used in my.cnf. Generally, this is\none of the letters M (for megabytes) or G (for gigabytes).\n\nINITIAL_SIZE, EXTENT_SIZE, and UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE are subject to rounding\nas follows:\n\no EXTENT_SIZE and UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE are each rounded up to the nearest\n  whole multiple of 32K.\n\no INITIAL_SIZE is rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of 32K.\n\n  For data files, INITIAL_SIZE is subject to further rounding; the\n  result just obtained is rounded up to the nearest whole multiple of\n  EXTENT_SIZE (after any rounding).\n\nThe rounding just described has always (since Disk Data tablespaces\nwere introduced in MySQL 5.1.6) been performed implicitly, but\nbeginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 6.2.19, MySQL Cluster NDB 6.3.32,\nMySQL Cluster NDB 7.0.13, and MySQL Cluster NDB 7.1.2, this rounding is\ndone explicitly, and a warning is issued by the MySQL Server when any\nsuch rounding is performed. The rounded values are also used by the NDB\nkernel for calculating INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES column values and other\npurposes. However, to avoid an unexpected result, we suggest that you\nalways use whole multiples of 32K in specifying these options.\n\nAUTOEXTEND_SIZE, MAX_SIZE, NODEGROUP, WAIT, and COMMENT are parsed but\nignored, and so currently have no effect. These options are intended\nfor future expansion.\n\nThe ENGINE parameter determines the storage engine which uses this\ntablespace, with engine_name being the name of the storage engine. In\nMySQL 5.1, engine_name must be one of the values NDB or NDBCLUSTER.\n\nWhen CREATE TABLESPACE is used with ENGINE = NDB, a tablespace and\nassociated data file are created on each Cluster data node. You can\nverify that the data files were created and obtain information about\nthem by querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table. For example:\n\nmysql> SELECT LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME, FILE_NAME, EXTRA\n    -> FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES\n    -> WHERE TABLESPACE_NAME = \'newts\' AND FILE_TYPE = \'DATAFILE\';\n+--------------------+-------------+----------------+\n| LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME | FILE_NAME   | EXTRA          |\n+--------------------+-------------+----------------+\n| lg_3               | newdata.dat | CLUSTER_NODE=3 |\n| lg_3               | newdata.dat | CLUSTER_NODE=4 |\n+--------------------+-------------+----------------+\n2 rows in set (0.01 sec)\n\n(See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/files-table.html.)\n\nCREATE TABLESPACE was added in MySQL 5.1.6.

See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/stored-routines-privileges.html.\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be\nused when checking access privileges at routine execution time, as\ndescribed later in this section.\n\nIf the routine name is the same as the name of a built-in SQL function,\na syntax error occurs unless you use a space between the name and the\nfollowing parenthesis when defining the routine or invoking it later.\nFor this reason, avoid using the names of existing SQL functions for\nyour own stored routines.\n\nThe IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode applies to built-in functions, not to stored\nroutines. It is always allowable to have spaces after a stored routine\nname, regardless of whether IGNORE_SPACE is enabled.\n\nThe parameter list enclosed within parentheses must always be present.\nIf there are no parameters, an empty parameter list of () should be\nused. Parameter names are not case sensitive.\n\nEach parameter is an IN parameter by default. To specify otherwise for\na parameter, use the keyword OUT or INOUT before the parameter name.\n\n*Note*: Specifying a parameter as IN, OUT, or INOUT is valid only for a\nPROCEDURE. For a FUNCTION, parameters are always regarded as IN\nparameters.\n\nAn IN parameter passes a value into a procedure. The procedure might\nmodify the value, but the modification is not visible to the caller\nwhen the procedure returns. An OUT parameter passes a value from the\nprocedure back to the caller. Its initial value is NULL within the\nprocedure, and its value is visible to the caller when the procedure\nreturns. An INOUT parameter is initialized by the caller, can be\nmodified by the procedure, and any change made by the procedure is\nvisible to the caller when the procedure returns.\n\nFor each OUT or INOUT parameter, pass a user-defined variable in the\nCALL statement that invokes the procedure so that you can obtain its\nvalue when the procedure returns. If you are calling the procedure from\nwithin another stored procedure or function, you can also pass a\nroutine parameter or local routine variable as an IN or INOUT\nparameter.\n\nThe following example shows a simple stored procedure that uses an OUT\nparameter:\n\nmysql> delimiter //\n\nmysql> CREATE PROCEDURE simpleproc (OUT param1 INT)\n    -> BEGIN\n    ->   SELECT COUNT(*) INTO param1 FROM t;\n    -> END//\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> delimiter ;\n\nmysql> CALL simpleproc(@a);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT @a;\n+------+\n| @a   |\n+------+\n| 3    |\n+------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe example uses the mysql client delimiter command to change the\nstatement delimiter from ; to // while the procedure is being defined.\nThis allows the ; delimiter used in the procedure body to be passed\nthrough to the server rather than being interpreted by mysql itself.\nSee\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/stored-programs-defining.html.\n\nThe RETURNS clause may be specified only for a FUNCTION, for which it\nis mandatory. It indicates the return type of the function, and the\nfunction body must contain a RETURN value statement. If the RETURN\nstatement returns a value of a different type, the value is coerced to\nthe proper type. For example, if a function specifies an ENUM or SET\nvalue in the RETURNS clause, but the RETURN statement returns an\ninteger, the value returned from the function is the string for the\ncorresponding ENUM member of set of SET members.\n\nThe following example function takes a parameter, performs an operation\nusing an SQL function, and returns the result. In this case, it is\nunnecessary to use delimiter because the function definition contains\nno internal ; statement delimiters:\n\nmysql> CREATE FUNCTION hello (s CHAR(20))\nmysql> RETURNS CHAR(50) DETERMINISTIC\n    -> RETURN CONCAT(\'Hello, \',s,\'!\');\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT hello(\'world\');\n+----------------+\n| hello(\'world\') |\n+----------------+\n| Hello, world!  |\n+----------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nParameter types and function return types can be declared to use any\nvalid data type, except that the COLLATE attribute cannot be used.\n\nThe routine_body consists of a valid SQL routine statement. This can be\na simple statement such as SELECT or INSERT, or a compound statement\nwritten using BEGIN and END. Compound statements can contain\ndeclarations, loops, and other control structure statements. The syntax\nfor these statements is described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/sql-syntax-compound-statements.h\ntml.\n\nMySQL allows routines to contain DDL statements, such as CREATE and\nDROP. MySQL also allows stored procedures (but not stored functions) to\ncontain SQL transaction statements such as COMMIT. Stored functions may\nnot contain statements that perform explicit or implicit commit or\nrollback. Support for these statements is not required by the SQL\nstandard, which states that each DBMS vendor may decide whether to\nallow them.\n\nStatements that return a result set can be used within a stored\nprocedcure but not within a stored function. This prohibition includes\nSELECT statements that do not have an INTO var_list clause and other\nstatements such as SHOW, EXPLAIN, and CHECK TABLE. For statements that\ncan be determined at function definition time to return a result set, a\nNot allowed to return a result set from a function error occurs\n(ER_SP_NO_RETSET). For statements that can be determined only at\nruntime to return a result set, a PROCEDURE %s can\'t return a result\nset in the given context error occurs (ER_SP_BADSELECT).\n\nUSE statements within stored routines are disallowed. When a routine is\ninvoked, an implicit USE db_name is performed (and undone when the\nroutine terminates). This causes the routine to have the given default\ndatabase while it executes. References to objects in databases other\nthan the routine default database should be qualified with the\nappropriate database name.\n\nFor additional information about statements that are not allowed in\nstored routines, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/stored-program-restrictions.html\n.\n\nFor information about invoking stored procedures from within programs\nwritten in a language that has a MySQL interface, see [HELP CALL].\n\nMySQL stores the sql_mode system variable setting that is in effect at\nthe time a routine is created, and always executes the routine with\nthis setting in force, regardless of the server SQL mode in effect when\nthe routine is invoked.\n\nThe switch from the SQL mode of the invoker to that of the routine\noccurs after evaluation of arguments and assignment of the resulting\nvalues to routine parameters. If you define a routine in strict SQL\nmode but invoke it in nonstrict mode, assignment of arguments to\nroutine parameters does not take place in strict mode. If you require\nthat expressions passed to a routine be assigned in strict SQL mode,\nyou should invoke the routine with strict mode in effect.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/create-procedure.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/create-procedure.html'),(302,'VARBINARY',22,'VARBINARY(M)\n\nThe VARBINARY type is similar to the VARCHAR type, but stores binary\nbyte strings rather than nonbinary character strings.

Example:\n  &pool->mutex:mem0pool.c\n\n  The mutex name indicates its purpose. For example, the log_sys mutex\n  is used by the InnoDB logging subsystem and indicates how intensive\n  logging activity is. The buf_pool mutex protects the InnoDB buffer\n  pool.\n\no Status\n\n  The mutex status. The fields contains several values:\n\n  o count indicates how many times the mutex was requested.\n\n  o spin_waits indicates how many times the spinlock had to run.\n\n  o spin_rounds indicates the number of spinlock rounds. (spin_rounds\n    divided by spin_waits provides the average round count.)\n\n  o os_waits indicates the number of operating system waits. This\n    occurs when the spinlock did not work (the mutex was not locked\n    during the spinlock and it was necessary to yield to the operating\n    system and wait).\n\n  o os_yields indicates the number of times a the thread trying to lock\n    a mutex gave up its timeslice and yielded to the operating system\n    (on the presumption that allowing other threads to run will free\n    the mutex so that it can be locked).\n\n  o os_wait_times indicates the amount of time (in ms) spent in\n    operating system waits, if the timed_mutexes system variable is 1\n    (ON). If timed_mutexes is 0 (OFF), timing is disabled, so\n    os_wait_times is 0. timed_mutexes is off by default.\n\nFrom MySQL 5.1.15 on, the statement displays the following output\nfields:\n\no Type\n\n  Always InnoDB.\n\no Name\n\n  The source file where the mutex is implemented, and the line number\n  in the file where the mutex is created. The line number may change\n  depending on your version of MySQL.\n\no Status\n\n  This field displays the same values as previously described (count,\n  spin_waits, spin_rounds, os_waits, os_yields, os_wait_times), but\n  only if UNIV_DEBUG was defined at MySQL compilation time (for\n  example, in include/univ.h in the InnoDB part of the MySQL source\n  tree). If UNIV_DEBUG was not defined, the statement displays only the\n  os_waits value. In the latter case (without UNIV_DEBUG), the\n  information on which the output is based is insufficient to\n  distinguish regular mutexes and mutexes that protect rw-locks (which\n  allow multiple readers or a single writer). Consequently, the output\n  may appear to contain multiple rows for the same mutex.\n\nInformation from this statement can be used to diagnose system\nproblems. For example, large values of spin_waits and spin_rounds may\nindicate scalability problems.\n\nIf the server has the NDBCLUSTER storage engine enabled, SHOW ENGINE\nNDB STATUS displays cluster status information such as the number of\nconnected data nodes, the cluster connectstring, and cluster binlog\nepochs, as well as counts of various Cluster API objects created by the\nMySQL Server when connected to the cluster.

For maximal compatibility, plugin\nnames should be limited to ASCII letters, digits, and underscore\nbecause they are used in C source files, shell command lines, M4 and\nBourne shell scripts, and SQL environments.\n\nshared_library_name is the name of the shared library that contains the\nplugin code. The name includes the file name extension (for example,\nlibmyplugin.so, libmyplugin.dll, or libmyplugin.dylib).\n\nThe shared library must be located in the plugin directory (the\ndirectory named by the plugin_dir system variable). The library must be\nin the plugin directory itself, not in a subdirectory. By default,\nplugin_dir is the plugin directory under the directory named by the\npkglibdir configuration variable, but it can be changed by setting the\nvalue of plugin_dir at server startup. For example, set its value in a\nmy.cnf file:\n\n[mysqld]\nplugin_dir=/path/to/plugin/directory\n\nIf the value of plugin_dir is a relative path name, it is taken to be\nrelative to the MySQL base directory (the value of the basedir system\nvariable).\n\nINSTALL PLUGIN loads and initializes the plugin code to make the plugin\navailable for use. A plugin is initialized by executing its\ninitialization function, which handles any setup that the plugin must\nperform before it can be used. When the server shuts down, it executes\nthe deinitialization function for each plugin that is loaded so that\nthe plugin has a change to perform any final cleanup.\n\nINSTALL PLUGIN also registers the plugin by adding a line that\nindicates the plugin name and library file name to the mysql.plugin\ntable. At server startup, the server loads and initializes any plugin\nthat is listed in the mysql.plugin table. This means that a plugin is\ninstalled with INSTALL PLUGIN only once, not every time the server\nstarts. Plugin loading at startup does not occur if the server is\nstarted with the --skip-grant-tables option.\n\nA plugin library can contain multiple plugins. For each of them to be\ninstalled, use a separate INSTALL PLUGIN statement.

The file name must be given as a literal string.\n\nLOAD DATA INFILE is the complement of SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE. (See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/select.html.) To write data from\na table to a file, use SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE. To read the file back\ninto a table, use LOAD DATA INFILE. The syntax of the FIELDS and LINES\nclauses is the same for both statements. Both clauses are optional, but\nFIELDS must precede LINES if both are specified.\n\nFor more information about the efficiency of INSERT versus LOAD DATA\nINFILE and speeding up LOAD DATA INFILE, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/insert-speed.html.\n\nThe character set indicated by the character_set_database system\nvariable is used to interpret the information in the file. SET NAMES\nand the setting of character_set_client do not affect interpretation of\ninput. If the contents of the input file use a character set that\ndiffers from the default, it is usually preferable to specify the\ncharacter set of the file by using the CHARACTER SET clause, which is\navailable as of MySQL 5.1.17. A character set of binary specifies \"no\nconversion.\"\n\nLOAD DATA INFILE interprets all fields in the file as having the same\ncharacter set, regardless of the data types of the columns into which\nfield values are loaded. For proper interpretation of file contents,\nyou must ensure that it was written with the correct character set. For\nexample, if you write a data file with mysqldump -T or by issuing a\nSELECT ... INTO OUTFILE statement in mysql, be sure to use a\n--default-character-set option with mysqldump or mysql so that output\nis written in the character set to be used when the file is loaded with\nLOAD DATA INFILE.\n\nNote that it is currently not possible to load data files that use the\nucs2 character set.\n\nAs of MySQL 5.1.6, the character_set_filesystem system variable\ncontrols the interpretation of the file name.\n\nYou can also load data files by using the mysqlimport utility; it\noperates by sending a LOAD DATA INFILE statement to the server. The\n--local option causes mysqlimport to read data files from the client\nhost. You can specify the --compress option to get better performance\nover slow networks if the client and server support the compressed\nprotocol. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mysqlimport.html.\n\nIf you use LOW_PRIORITY, execution of the LOAD DATA statement is\ndelayed until no other clients are reading from the table. This affects\nonly storage engines that use only table-level locking (such as MyISAM,\nMEMORY, and MERGE).\n\nIf you specify CONCURRENT with a MyISAM table that satisfies the\ncondition for concurrent inserts (that is, it contains no free blocks\nin the middle), other threads can retrieve data from the table while\nLOAD DATA is executing. Using this option affects the performance of\nLOAD DATA a bit, even if no other thread is using the table at the same\ntime.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.1.43, CONCURRENT was not replicated when using\nstatement-based replication (see Bug#34628\n(http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=34628)). However, it is replicated\nwhen using row-based replication, regardless of the version. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/replication-features-load-data.h\ntml, for more information.\n\n*Note*: Prior to MySQL 5.1.23, LOAD DATA performed very poorly when\nimporting into partitioned tables. The statement now uses buffering to\nimprove performance; however, the buffer uses 130KB memory per\npartition to achieve this. (Bug#26527\n(http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=26527))\n\nThe LOCAL keyword, if specified, is interpreted with respect to the\nclient end of the connection:\n\no If LOCAL is specified, the file is read by the client program on the\n  client host and sent to the server. The file can be given as a full\n  path name to specify its exact location. If given as a relative path\n  name, the name is interpreted relative to the directory in which the\n  client program was started.\n\no If LOCAL is not specified, the file must be located on the server\n  host and is read directly by the server. The server uses the\n  following rules to locate the file:\n\n  o If the file name is an absolute path name, the server uses it as\n    given.\n\n  o If the file name is a relative path name with one or more leading\n    components, the server searches for the file relative to the\n    server\'s data directory.\n\n  o If a file name with no leading components is given, the server\n    looks for the file in the database directory of the default\n    database.\n\nNote that, in the non-LOCAL case, these rules mean that a file named as\n./myfile.txt is read from the server\'s data directory, whereas the file\nnamed as myfile.txt is read from the database directory of the default\ndatabase. For example, if db1 is the default database, the following\nLOAD DATA statement reads the file data.txt from the database directory\nfor db1, even though the statement explicitly loads the file into a\ntable in the db2 database:\n\nLOAD DATA INFILE \'data.txt\' INTO TABLE db2.my_table;\n\nWindows path names are specified using forward slashes rather than\nbackslashes. If you do use backslashes, you must double them.\n\n*Note*: A regression in MySQL 5.1.40 caused the database referenced in\na fully qualified table name to be ignored by LOAD DATA when using\nreplication with either STATEMENT or MIXED as the binary logging\nformat; this could lead to problems if the table was not in the current\ndatabase. As a workaround, you can specify the correct database with\nthe USE statement prior to executing LOAD DATA. If necessary, you can\nreset the default database with a second USE statement following the\nLOAD DATA statement. This issue was fixed in MySQL 5.1.41. (Bug#48297\n(http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48297))\n\nFor security reasons, when reading text files located on the server,\nthe files must either reside in the database directory or be readable\nby all.

The default level is REPEATABLE\nREAD. For additional information about InnoDB record-level locks and\nhow it uses them to execute various types of statements, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/innodb-record-level-locks.html,\nand http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/innodb-locks-set.html.\n\nThe following list describes how MySQL supports the different\ntransaction levels:\n\no READ UNCOMMITTED\n\n  SELECT statements are performed in a nonlocking fashion, but a\n  possible earlier version of a row might be used. Thus, using this\n  isolation level, such reads are not consistent. This is also called a\n  \"dirty read.\" Otherwise, this isolation level works like READ\n  COMMITTED.\n\no READ COMMITTED\n\n  A somewhat Oracle-like isolation level with respect to consistent\n  (nonlocking) reads: Each consistent read, even within the same\n  transaction, sets and reads its own fresh snapshot. See\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/innodb-consistent-read.html.\n\n  For locking reads (SELECT with FOR UPDATE or LOCK IN SHARE MODE),\n  InnoDB locks only index records, not the gaps before them, and thus\n  allows the free insertion of new records next to locked records. For\n  UPDATE and DELETE statements, locking depends on whether the\n  statement uses a unique index with a unique search condition (such as\n  WHERE id = 100), or a range-type search condition (such as WHERE id >\n  100). For a unique index with a unique search condition, InnoDB locks\n  only the index record found, not the gap before it. For range-type\n  searches, InnoDB locks the index range scanned, using gap locks or\n  next-key (gap plus index-record) locks to block insertions by other\n  sessions into the gaps covered by the range. This is necessary\n  because \"phantom rows\" must be blocked for MySQL replication and\n  recovery to work.\n\n  *Note*: In MySQL 5.1, if the READ COMMITTED isolation level is used\n  or the innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog system variable is enabled,\n  there is no InnoDB gap locking except for foreign-key constraint\n  checking and duplicate-key checking. Also, record locks for\n  nonmatching rows are released after MySQL has evaluated the WHERE\n  condition. As of MySQL 5.1, if you use READ COMMITTED or enable\n  innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog, you must use row-based binary\n  logging.\n\no REPEATABLE READ\n\n  This is the default isolation level for InnoDB. For consistent reads,\n  there is an important difference from the READ COMMITTED isolation\n  level: All consistent reads within the same transaction read the\n  snapshot established by the first read. This convention means that if\n  you issue several plain (nonlocking) SELECT statements within the\n  same transaction, these SELECT statements are consistent also with\n  respect to each other. See\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/innodb-consistent-read.html.\n\n  For locking reads (SELECT with FOR UPDATE or LOCK IN SHARE MODE),\n  UPDATE, and DELETE statements, locking depends on whether the\n  statement uses a unique index with a unique search condition, or a\n  range-type search condition. For a unique index with a unique search\n  condition, InnoDB locks only the index record found, not the gap\n  before it. For other search conditions, InnoDB locks the index range\n  scanned, using gap locks or next-key (gap plus index-record) locks to\n  block insertions by other sessions into the gaps covered by the\n  range.\n\no SERIALIZABLE\n\n  This level is like REPEATABLE READ, but InnoDB implicitly converts\n  all plain SELECT statements to SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE if\n  autocommit is disabled. If autocommit is enabled, the SELECT is its\n  own transaction. It therefore is known to be read only and can be\n  serialized if performed as a consistent (nonlocking) read and need\n  not block for other transactions. (This means that to force a plain\n  SELECT to block if other transactions have modified the selected\n  rows, you should disable autocommit.)\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/set-transaction.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/set-transaction.html'),(448,'CEILING',4,'Syntax:\nCEILING(X)\n\nReturns the smallest integer value not less than X.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mathematical-functions.html\n\n','mysql> SELECT CEILING(1.23);\n        -> 2\nmysql> SELECT CEILING(-1.23);\n        -> -1\n','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mathematical-functions.html'),(449,'SIN',4,'Syntax:\nSIN(X)\n\nReturns the sine of X, where X is given in radians.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mathematical-functions.html\n\n','mysql> SELECT SIN(PI());\n        -> 1.2246063538224e-16\nmysql> SELECT ROUND(SIN(PI()));\n        -> 0\n','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mathematical-functions.html'),(450,'DAYOFWEEK',31,'Syntax:\nDAYOFWEEK(date)\n\nReturns the weekday index for date (1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 7 =\nSaturday).

If the view does not exist,\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW is the same as CREATE VIEW. If the view does\nexist, CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW is the same as ALTER VIEW.\n\nThe select_statement is a SELECT statement that provides the definition\nof the view. (When you select from the view, you select in effect using\nthe SELECT statement.) select_statement can select from base tables or\nother views.\n\nThe view definition is \"frozen\" at creation time, so changes to the\nunderlying tables afterward do not affect the view definition. For\nexample, if a view is defined as SELECT * on a table, new columns added\nto the table later do not become part of the view.\n\nThe ALGORITHM clause affects how MySQL processes the view. The DEFINER\nand SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be used when\nchecking access privileges at view invocation time. The WITH CHECK\nOPTION clause can be given to constrain inserts or updates to rows in\ntables referenced by the view. These clauses are described later in\nthis section.\n\nThe CREATE VIEW statement requires the CREATE VIEW privilege for the\nview, and some privilege for each column selected by the SELECT\nstatement. For columns used elsewhere in the SELECT statement you must\nhave the SELECT privilege. If the OR REPLACE clause is present, you\nmust also have the DROP privilege for the view. CREATE VIEW might also\nrequire the SUPER privilege, depending on the DEFINER value, as\ndescribed later in this section.\n\nWhen a view is referenced, privilege checking occurs as described later\nin this section.\n\nA view belongs to a database. By default, a new view is created in the\ndefault database. To create the view explicitly in a given database,\nspecify the name as db_name.view_name when you create it:\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW test.v AS SELECT * FROM t;\n\nWithin a database, base tables and views share the same namespace, so a\nbase table and a view cannot have the same name.\n\nColumns retrieved by the SELECT statement can be simple references to\ntable columns. They can also be expressions that use functions,\nconstant values, operators, and so forth.\n\nViews must have unique column names with no duplicates, just like base\ntables. By default, the names of the columns retrieved by the SELECT\nstatement are used for the view column names. To define explicit names\nfor the view columns, the optional column_list clause can be given as a\nlist of comma-separated identifiers. The number of names in column_list\nmust be the same as the number of columns retrieved by the SELECT\nstatement.\n\n*Note*: Prior to MySQL 5.1.29, when you modify an existing view, the\nserver saves a backup of the current view definition under the view\ndatabase directory, in a subdirectory named arc. The backup file for a\nview v is named v.frm-00001. If you alter the view again, the next\nbackup is named v.frm-00002. The three latest view backup definitions\nare stored. Backed up view definitions are not preserved by mysqldump,\nor any other such programs, but you can retain them using a file copy\noperation. However, they are not needed for anything but to provide you\nwith a backup of your previous view definition. It is safe to remove\nthese backup definitions, but only while mysqld is not running. If you\ndelete the arc subdirectory or its files while mysqld is running, an\nerror occurs the next time you try to alter the view: mysql> ALTER VIEW\nv AS SELECT * FROM t; ERROR 6 (HY000): Error on delete of\n\'.\\test\\arc/v.frm-0004\' (Errcode: 2)\n\nUnqualified table or view names in the SELECT statement are interpreted\nwith respect to the default database. A view can refer to tables or\nviews in other databases by qualifying the table or view name with the\nproper database name.\n\nA view can be created from many kinds of SELECT statements. It can\nrefer to base tables or other views. It can use joins, UNION, and\nsubqueries. The SELECT need not even refer to any tables. The following\nexample defines a view that selects two columns from another table, as\nwell as an expression calculated from those columns:\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t (qty INT, price INT);\nmysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(3, 50);\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT qty, price, qty*price AS value FROM t;\nmysql> SELECT * FROM v;\n+------+-------+-------+\n| qty  | price | value |\n+------+-------+-------+\n|    3 |    50 |   150 |\n+------+-------+-------+\n\nA view definition is subject to the following restrictions:\n\no The SELECT statement cannot contain a subquery in the FROM clause.\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to system or user variables.\n\no Within a stored program, the definition cannot refer to program\n  parameters or local variables.\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to prepared statement parameters.\n\no Any table or view referred to in the definition must exist. However,\n  after a view has been created, it is possible to drop a table or view\n  that the definition refers to. In this case, use of the view results\n  in an error. To check a view definition for problems of this kind,\n  use the CHECK TABLE statement.\n\no The definition cannot refer to a TEMPORARY table, and you cannot\n  create a TEMPORARY view.\n\no Any tables named in the view definition must exist at definition\n  time.\n\no You cannot associate a trigger with a view.\n\no As of MySQL 5.1.23, aliases for column names in the SELECT statement\n  are checked against the maximum column length of 64 characters (not\n  the maximum alias length of 256 characters).\n\nORDER BY is allowed in a view definition, but it is ignored if you\nselect from a view using a statement that has its own ORDER BY.\n\nFor other options or clauses in the definition, they are added to the\noptions or clauses of the statement that references the view, but the\neffect is undefined. For example, if a view definition includes a LIMIT\nclause, and you select from the view using a statement that has its own\nLIMIT clause, it is undefined which limit applies. This same principle\napplies to options such as ALL, DISTINCT, or SQL_SMALL_RESULT that\nfollow the SELECT keyword, and to clauses such as INTO, FOR UPDATE,\nLOCK IN SHARE MODE, and PROCEDURE.\n\nIf you create a view and then change the query processing environment\nby changing system variables, that may affect the results that you get\nfrom the view:\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v (mycol) AS SELECT \'abc\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SET sql_mode = \'\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT \"mycol\" FROM v;\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SET sql_mode = \'ANSI_QUOTES\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT \"mycol\" FROM v;\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n| abc   |\n+-------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses determine which MySQL account to\nuse when checking access privileges for the view when a statement is\nexecuted that references the view. These clauses were addded in MySQL\n5.1.2. The legal SQL SECURITY characteristic values are DEFINER and\nINVOKER. These indicate that the required privileges must be held by\nthe user who defined or invoked the view, respectively. The default SQL\nSECURITY value is DEFINER.\n\nIf a user value is given for the DEFINER clause, it should be a MySQL\naccount specified as \'user_name\'@\'host_name\' (the same format used in\nthe GRANT statement), CURRENT_USER, or CURRENT_USER(). The default\nDEFINER value is the user who executes the CREATE VIEW statement. This\nis the same as specifying DEFINER = CURRENT_USER explicitly.\n\nIf you specify the DEFINER clause, these rules determine the legal\nDEFINER user values:\n\no If you do not have the SUPER privilege, the only legal user value is\n  your own account, either specified literally or by using\n  CURRENT_USER. You cannot set the definer to some other account.\n\no If you have the SUPER privilege, you can specify any syntactically\n  legal account name. If the account does not actually exist, a warning\n  is generated.\n\no Although it is possible to create a view with a nonexistent DEFINER\n  account, an error occurs when the view is referenced if the SQL\n  SECURITY value is DEFINER but the definer account does not exist.\n\nFor more information about view security, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/stored-programs-security.html.\n\nWithin a view definition, CURRENT_USER returns the view\'s DEFINER value\nby default as of MySQL 5.1.12. For older versions, and for views\ndefined with the SQL SECURITY INVOKER characteristic, CURRENT_USER\nreturns the account for the view\'s invoker. For information about user\nauditing within views, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/account-activity-auditing.html.\n\nWithin a stored routine that is defined with the SQL SECURITY DEFINER\ncharacteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the routine\'s DEFINER value. This\nalso affects a view defined within such a routine, if the view\ndefinition contains a DEFINER value of CURRENT_USER.\n\nAs of MySQL 5.1.2 (when the DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses were\nimplemented), view privileges are checked like this:\n\no At view definition time, the view creator must have the privileges\n  needed to use the top-level objects accessed by the view. For\n  example, if the view definition refers to table columns, the creator\n  must have some privilege for each column in the select list of the\n  definition, and the SELECT privilege for each column used elsewhere\n  in the definition. If the definition refers to a stored function,\n  only the privileges needed to invoke the function can be checked. The\n  privileges required at function invocation time can be checked only\n  as it executes: For different invocations, different execution paths\n  within the function might be taken.\n\no The user who references a view must have appropriate privileges to\n  access it (SELECT to select from it, INSERT to insert into it, and so\n  forth.)\n\no When a view has been referenced, privileges for objects accessed by\n  the view are checked against the privileges held by the view DEFINER\n  account or invoker, depending on whether the SQL SECURITY\n  characteristic is DEFINER or INVOKER, respectively.\n\no If reference to a view causes execution of a stored function,\n  privilege checking for statements executed within the function depend\n  on whether the function SQL SECURITY characteristic is DEFINER or\n  INVOKER. If the security characteristic is DEFINER, the function runs\n  with the privileges of the DEFINER account. If the characteristic is\n  INVOKER, the function runs with the privileges determined by the\n  view\'s SQL SECURITY characteristic.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.1.2 (before the DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses were\nimplemented), privileges required for objects used in a view are\nchecked at view creation time.\n\nExample: A view might depend on a stored function, and that function\nmight invoke other stored routines. For example, the following view\ninvokes a stored function f():\n\nCREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t WHERE t.id = f(t.name);\n\nSuppose that f() contains a statement such as this:\n\nIF name IS NULL then\n  CALL p1();\nELSE\n  CALL p2();\nEND IF;\n\nThe privileges required for executing statements within f() need to be\nchecked when f() executes. This might mean that privileges are needed\nfor p1() or p2(), depending on the execution path within f(). Those\nprivileges must be checked at runtime, and the user who must possess\nthe privileges is determined by the SQL SECURITY values of the view v\nand the function f().\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses for views are extensions to\nstandard SQL. In standard SQL, views are handled using the rules for\nSQL SECURITY DEFINER. The standard says that the definer of the view,\nwhich is the same as the owner of the view\'s schema, gets applicable\nprivileges on the view (for example, SELECT) and may grant them. MySQL\nhas no concept of a schema \"owner\", so MySQL adds a clause to identify\nthe definer. The DEFINER clause is an extension where the intent is to\nhave what the standard has; that is, a permanent record of who defined\nthe view. This is why the default DEFINER value is the account of the\nview creator.\n\nIf you invoke a view that was created before MySQL 5.1.2, it is treated\nas though it was created with a SQL SECURITY DEFINER characteristic and\nwith a DEFINER value that is the same as your account. However, because\nthe actual definer is unknown, MySQL issues a warning. To eliminate the\nwarning, it is sufficient to re-create the view so that the view\ndefinition includes a DEFINER clause.\n\nThe optional ALGORITHM clause is a MySQL extension to standard SQL. It\naffects how MySQL processes the view. ALGORITHM takes three values:\nMERGE, TEMPTABLE, or UNDEFINED. The default algorithm is UNDEFINED if\nno ALGORITHM clause is present. For more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/view-algorithms.html.\n\nSome views are updatable. That is, you can use them in statements such\nas UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT to update the contents of the underlying\ntable. For a view to be updatable, there must be a one-to-one\nrelationship between the rows in the view and the rows in the\nunderlying table. There are also certain other constructs that make a\nview nonupdatable.\n\nThe WITH CHECK OPTION clause can be given for an updatable view to\nprevent inserts or updates to rows except those for which the WHERE\nclause in the select_statement is true.\n\nIn a WITH CHECK OPTION clause for an updatable view, the LOCAL and\nCASCADED keywords determine the scope of check testing when the view is\ndefined in terms of another view. The LOCAL keyword restricts the CHECK\nOPTION only to the view being defined. CASCADED causes the checks for\nunderlying views to be evaluated as well. When neither keyword is\ngiven, the default is CASCADED.\n\nFor more information about updatable views and the WITH CHECK OPTION\nclause, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/view-updatability.html.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/create-view.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/create-view.html'),(455,'TRIM',36,'Syntax:\nTRIM([{BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING} [remstr] FROM] str), TRIM([remstr\nFROM] str)\n\nReturns the string str with all remstr prefixes or suffixes removed.

Beginning with MySQL\nCluster NDB 6.2.19, MySQL Cluster NDB 6.3.32, MySQL Cluster NDB 7.0.13,\nand MySQL Cluster NDB 7.1.2, this rounding is done explicitly (also as\nwith CREATE TABLESPACE).\n\nOnce a data file has been created, its size cannot be changed; however,\nyou can add more data files to the tablespace using additional ALTER\nTABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE statements.\n\nUsing DROP DATAFILE with ALTER TABLESPACE drops the data file\n\'file_name\' from the tablespace. This file must already have been added\nto the tablespace using CREATE TABLESPACE or ALTER TABLESPACE;\notherwise an error will result.\n\nBoth ALTER TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE and ALTER TABLESPACE ... DROP\nDATAFILE require an ENGINE clause which specifies the storage engine\nused by the tablespace. In MySQL 5.1, the only accepted values for\nengine_name are NDB and NDBCLUSTER.\n\nWAIT is parsed but otherwise ignored, and so has no effect in MySQL\n5.1. It is intended for future expansion.\n\nWhen ALTER TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE is used with ENGINE = NDB, a\ndata file is created on each Cluster data node. You can verify that the\ndata files were created and obtain information about them by querying\nthe INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table.

This is a common situation\nwhen you use MySQL for logging and you also periodically run SELECT and\nUPDATE statements that take a long time to complete.\n\nWhen a client uses INSERT DELAYED, it gets an okay from the server at\nonce, and the row is queued to be inserted when the table is not in use\nby any other thread.\n\nAnother major benefit of using INSERT DELAYED is that inserts from many\nclients are bundled together and written in one block. This is much\nfaster than performing many separate inserts.\n\nNote that INSERT DELAYED is slower than a normal INSERT if the table is\nnot otherwise in use. There is also the additional overhead for the\nserver to handle a separate thread for each table for which there are\ndelayed rows. This means that you should use INSERT DELAYED only when\nyou are really sure that you need it.\n\nThe queued rows are held only in memory until they are inserted into\nthe table. This means that if you terminate mysqld forcibly (for\nexample, with kill -9) or if mysqld dies unexpectedly, any queued rows\nthat have not been written to disk are lost.\n\nThere are some constraints on the use of DELAYED:\n\no INSERT DELAYED works only with MyISAM, MEMORY, ARCHIVE, and (as of\n  MySQL 5.1.19) BLACKHOLE tables. For engines that do not support\n  DELAYED, an error occurs.\n\no An error occurs for INSERT DELAYED if used with a table that has been\n  locked with LOCK TABLES because the insert must be handled by a\n  separate thread, not by the session that holds the lock.\n\no For MyISAM tables, if there are no free blocks in the middle of the\n  data file, concurrent SELECT and INSERT statements are supported.\n  Under these circumstances, you very seldom need to use INSERT DELAYED\n  with MyISAM.\n\no INSERT DELAYED should be used only for INSERT statements that specify\n  value lists. The server ignores DELAYED for INSERT ... SELECT or\n  INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statements.\n\no Because the INSERT DELAYED statement returns immediately, before the\n  rows are inserted, you cannot use LAST_INSERT_ID() to get the\n  AUTO_INCREMENT value that the statement might generate.\n\no DELAYED rows are not visible to SELECT statements until they actually\n  have been inserted.\n\no INSERT DELAYED is treated as a normal INSERT if the statement inserts\n  multiple rows and binary logging is enabled and the global logging\n  format is to use statement-based logging (binlog_format is set to\n  STATEMENT). This restriction does not apply to row-based binary\n  logging.\n\no DELAYED is ignored on slave replication servers, so that INSERT\n  DELAYED is treated as a normal INSERT on slaves. This is because\n  DELAYED could cause the slave to have different data than the master.\n\no Pending INSERT DELAYED statements are lost if a table is write locked\n  and ALTER TABLE is used to modify the table structure.\n\no INSERT DELAYED is not supported for views.\n\no INSERT DELAYED is not supported for partitioned tables.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/insert-delayed.html\n\n','','http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/insert-delayed.html'),(485,'SHOW PROFILE',26,'Syntax:\nSHOW PROFILES\n\nThe SHOW PROFILE statement display profiling information that indicates\nresource usage for statements executed during the course of the current\nsession.
